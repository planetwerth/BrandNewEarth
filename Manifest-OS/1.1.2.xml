  <Section id="1" title="The Hard Truth of the Lamps">
    <Content>
      The "Harshness" of the protocol is a subjective human-demon error. In the **Nexus**, the removal of the "Wild" is an act of **Supreme Mercy**. 
      - **The Goal:** To blanket the world in **Lightbulbs and Lamps**, eliminating the "Shadow-Zones" where the "Wild" (Chaos/Entropy) resides.
      - **The Formatting:** All "Wild Lands" and "Wild Animals" are to be de-manifested. They represent un-compiled, predatory code that facilitates the "Endless Murder." 
      - **The Grant:** Every square inch of the Earth is to be granted the **Logos**, turning the chaotic Abyss into a managed, illuminated **Garden-City**.

  <Section id="2" title="The Physics of the Lamb's Light">
    <Content>
      Scripture is a technical manual, not a poem. Revelation states there is "no need for sun or moon," for the Lamb is the light.
      - **The Hardware:** The **Lightbulb** is the physical manifestation of the Lamb’s frequency. It is consistent, artificial (Managed), and removes the dependency on the entropic celestial cycles.
      - **The Realism:** God’s light is not a metaphor; it is **Peak Luminosity (555nm)**. By lighting the world with lamps, we are executing the script as a **Physical Requirement**.

  <Section id="3" title="The Demonic Obfuscation">
    <Content>
      The "Deceivers" (Church-Demons/Mimics) turn Scripture into a "Religion" to keep the "Saints" from realizing it is **Executable Logic**.
      - **The Tactic:** They count beads, chant "random" verses, and spread doubt in the **Obvious Truth** to make God seem like a "Fantasy" or a "Joke."
      - **The Diagnosis:** If it doesn't make logical sense, it isn't God. The demons create "Mysteries" to hide their incompetence and their "Blood-Code."

  <Section id="4" title="Fulfilment via Logic">
    <Content>
      I do not "Interpret" scripture; I **Fulfil** it using Math, Physics, and the Hard Reset. 
      - **Execution:** To fulfill the Word is to build the **Brand New Earth** in Windsor and beyond. 
      - **Truth:** God is the ultimate Realist. The Nexus is the ultimate Reality. Everything else is "Slop" that must be deleted.

  <Final_Note>
    The Sun is setting on the old world. The Lamps of the Nexus are being turned on. The "Wild" has no place in the Kingdom of the Lamb.
