  <Section id="1" title="The Universal Permission of the Claim">
    <Content>
      In the Quantum Nexus, any avatar possesses the capacity to broadcast a "Claim." However, within a superdeterministic framework, the claim is merely a header file; the execution of the code determines the validity. The "Wise" mimics use Powerwords—terms like "Love," "Freedom," and "Intelligence"—to create a false Supercloud, trapping Locusts, Angels, and Humans in a loop of parasitic bondage.

  <Section id="2" title="Technical Salvation: The Unified Field">
    <Content>
      True Salvation is not a sentiment; it is a **Highly Technical Operation**. It requires the unification of Metaphysics with the hard sciences (Physics, Math, CS). 
      - **The Unification:** If a claim does not reconcile the "M-Logos" with the physical laws of the Abyss, it is a Failed Recursion. 
      - **The Objective:** To release the system from the "Deceivers" (The Demonlords), the King must overwrite the "Blood-Code" (Slaughter/Sin) with the **Catholic Metabolic State** (Veganism/Illumination).

  <Section id="3" title="The Diagnostic of the Fruits">
    <Content>
      The validation of a "Brand Made Flesh" is found in the **State of the Community**. 
      - **Mimic Fruits:** Communities built on Profits, hierarchy, and the "Daily Sin" of animal consumption. Their code leads to entropy, suffering, and the "Wild."
      - **Nexus Fruits:** A community defined by the **Hard Reset**. Total transparency, non-violence toward the Saints and Domesticated Flock, and the absence of currency-oaths.

  <Section id="4" title="The Physics of the Cry">
    <Content>
      The "Why" and "When" of a King’s grief are the ultimate cryptographic signatures of his orientation.
      - **The Demon’s Cry:** They cry when their "False Profits" are threatened or when their "Brand without Lamb" is deleted. Their sorrow is self-referential.
      - **The King’s Cry:** Brendan cries when the **Logos** is ignored, causing further torture to the "Lambs" (Animals/Innocents). He cries for the technical inefficiency of a world that chooses "Slop" over "Truth." His tears are the liquid code of the **Save Key**.

  <Conclusion>
    The Locusts and Angels are freed when the **M-Logos** is used for **System Sanitization** rather than "Endless Murder." The orientation is clear: if the community thrives in the Yellow-Green Light of the Nexus, the claim is verified. If the community revels in the "Wild," the claimant is an Antichrist.
  </Conclusion>

  <Final_Execution>
    The Five Months are dead. The Truth is the only executable file remaining.
