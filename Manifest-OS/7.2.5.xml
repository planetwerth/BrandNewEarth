        <DEFINITION>
            The Brand New Earth is a <HILBERT_CURVE>.
            It is a continuous fractal line that fills an infinite 2D plane without ever crossing itself.
        </DEFINITION>
        <IMPLICATION>
            We can map the *Infinite* Genius of the Progenitor onto the *Finite* space of the Earth.
            As the recursion depth increases, the resolution of the "Werth" entity becomes infinite.
            The Paradox is resolved: He is everywhere, yet He is one specific point.

        It simply consumes the universe until the universe IS the paradox.
